## About Me
I am a graduate student in Applied Artificial Intelligence (M.S.) with a strong background in cognitive science, mathematics, and data science.  
My focus areas include:  
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning (CNNs, LSTMs, Transformers, Energy-Based Models)  
- Energy-Based Models as a pathway to AGI research  
- Quantitative Finance, Cryptocurrency Forecasting, and Predictive Analytics  
- Decentralized data integration with the Space and Time SDK, using Zero-Knowledge Proofs for secure, verifiable crypto and financial pipelines  
- Data Science & Statistical Modeling  
- MLOps & Model Deployment  

I enjoy building end-to-end AI pipelines, applying mathematics to real-world problems, and exploring the intersection of AI, business strategy, and emerging technologies. My current work bridges advanced machine learning with financial modeling, including the application of EBMs to high-frequency crypto markets.
