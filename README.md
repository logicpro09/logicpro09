## About Me
I am an AI and machine learning engineer with a background in cognitive science, mathematics, and applied data science. My work focuses on AI infrastructure, model inference performance, and building practical systems that improve the efficiency and reliability of modern machine learning models.

My focus areas include:
- High-performance machine learning and deep learning (CNNs, LSTMs, transformers)
- Model inference optimization using vLLM, PyTorch, and Triton
- GPU-oriented engineering, kernel exploration, and performance benchmarking
- Distributed and scalable ML systems using Ray and containerized workflows
- Reproducible evaluation pipelines and MLOps-aligned deployment practices

I enjoy designing end-to-end AI systems, optimizing model performance, and building tools that connect engineering rigor with real-world applications. My current work through SalixLogic centers on AI infrastructure, model serving, and the systems-level challenges behind efficient large-model deployment.
